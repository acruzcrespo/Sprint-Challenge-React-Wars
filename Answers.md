3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

4.  Describe state.

    - State is the data that our components will have access to. And when we pass that state around, we call it props. If a component holds it’s own state, and needs to give that state data to another component, we pass that state around as Props.

5.  Describe props.

    - Props simple receive them in our components and use them to display data to the user. When we give a component some data on our JSX, we’re essentially telling React to build us out an object that we can consume as a parameter inside of a Functional Component.
